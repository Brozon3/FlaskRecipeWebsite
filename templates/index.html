        <span>This website was created to replicate a cookbook that was created by my good friend Shannon.
        <br>
        Shannon created this cookbook in December 2012 as a Christmas gift to her close circle of friends
        <br>
        and this cookbook has been getting significant use since. All the recipes can be found by clicking
        <br>
        on the 'Recipes' tab or using the search bar.
